# College Football Advertising Strategy

Worked with metrics concerning football games including: 
* revenues
* expenditures
* game attendance rates
* TV ratings

## Sources
This database is built on tables that were extracted and transformed from three different sources:

1) TV Ratings - TV ratings were scraped using Beautiful Soup and cleaned up with excel. The website with this information can be found at: http://wwwsportsmediawatch.com.college-football-tv-ratings.

2) Game attendance - Game attendance was extracted from the ncaa website at: http://www.ncaa.org/championships/statistics/ncaa-football-attendance. An app called Tabula was used to generate CSV files from the PDFs. Excel was used to clean up and format the data.

3) Revenues, expenditures - Data for game revenue, expenditures, and demographic data was downloaded as .CSV file from: https://ope.ed.gov/athletics/#/. Data was then cleaned in excel.
